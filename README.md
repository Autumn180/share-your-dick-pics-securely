# Share Your Dick Pics More Securely

> A guide on how to share your dick pics securely.

**NOTE:** If you follow this guide, we can't guarantee that your dick pics can't be accessed by the NSA. But following this guide is definitely more secure than just sending them using any social media or instant messaging service.

Feel free to contribute to this repository. If you have any other way you want to recommend not listed here, feel free to include it in the list.

## Background

It all started in April when John Oliver went to Russia to [interview Edward Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M) for his award-winning show called [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ). During the interview, John asked Edward of the ways NSA's programs affect regular Internet users when they are sharing their dick pics.

Then, [Quinn Norton](http://quinnnorton.com/) published [an article](https://medium.com/message/stop-taking-dick-pics-but-not-because-of-the-nsa-3b3adc8ad05d) saying that you should stop sending your dick pics all together.

If you're not convinced and you still want to send your dick pics, at least do it in a more secure way.

## The Guide

The guide is divided into different ways depending on its difficulty. Easier ways are less secure and more difficult ways are more secure. Every way is better than sharing your dick pic using social medias and IM services. Choose the option that you find fit considering your level of paranoia and technical abilities of both you and your receiver.

### Easiest way

Upload your dic pick using a photo sharing service (I suggest [imgur](http://imgur.com/)). Make a user account so you have full control over your pictures. Delete the picture as soon as you're sure that the receiver saw it.

### Easy way

Use a service like [Wickr](https://wickr.com/) that deletes the message after a specified amount of time.

### Slightly harder way

Use an online tool (like [Encryptur](https://encryptur.com/)) to encrypt your dick pic. Tell the receiver the password to decrypt it. The best way to share your password is in person. The next best thing is over the phone. The worst way is to send the password over the Internet, where the message gets stored. Make sure to use a service that allows you to delete the encrypted photo once it's received.

### Hard way

Encrypt the photos locally using the AES algorithm and share the container with your receiver using your favorite cloud storage service. Make sure that you give the access only to the people who have the link. Share the password with the receiver in person. Change the password oftenly and use really long passwords.

### Super hard and costly extreme way

**Host your own web server**. Be sure to trust your hosting company or host one from your home. Buy an SSL certificate.

**Create two email addresses on your web server**, one for you (as a sender) and the second one for your partner.

**Exchange encryption keys with your partner.** You'll need a long (but memorable) password that you will share with your partner. Instead of using short gibberish, make your password as long as possible. Share the password with your partner _in person_. Don't do it over the Internet or over the phone. Change the password as often as possible.

**Encrypt your picture with AES-256**, using the password you've shared with your partner.

**Send a picture through email and sign it.** Use PGP/GPG to sign your message so the receiver knows your identity and knows that the message was not modified on its way.

**Don't use no proprietary software on your end device.**
So, no Windows, no Macs, no iOS, no Windows Phone, no Blackberry and no Android. Use only free and open source software such as Linux or BSD for your computer/laptop/tablet and a _completely_ open source operating system for your smartphone or tablet (something like Cyanogenmod or Firefox OS). Encrypt your end devices.

**Delete the dick pic after you saw it.** Don't leave it on your hard drive.
